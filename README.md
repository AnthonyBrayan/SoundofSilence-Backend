## üíª Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
***
1. **Relational Data Structure:** In a relational database management system, data is organized in tables. Each table contains rows and columns. Each row represents an individual entry or record, and each column defines a specific attribute of those records. Tables are designed in such a way that they can be related to each other through primary keys and foreign keys.

2. **Primary and Foreign Keys:** In a relational table, each row usually has a column called the primary key. The primary key is a unique value that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Other tables may have columns called foreign keys that reference the primary key of another table. This allows you to establish relationships between tables and link data in different ways.

3. **Relationships and Queries:** Relational tables allow you to model complex relationships between different types of data. This is useful in situations where data is interconnected. For example, in an application like Sound of Silence, you can have a user table with personal information and a comments table that is related to the user table through a foreign key that identifies the author of the comment. This makes it easy to retrieve related data and perform complex queries.

4. **Referential Integrity:** Relational tables are also useful in maintaining referential integrity in the database. This means that relationships between data are kept consistent and references to non-existent or corrupt data are not allowed. Relational databases are designed to ensure that relationships between data are maintained correctly.

In the context of your Sound of Silence platform, "relationship table" could refer to a table in the database that stores data related to user interaction on the platform. For example, it could contain records of who follows whom, who has commented on whose posts, or any other social interaction between users. This table would allow for tracking and managing relationships and interactions in the user community.

### üíª Versions of some technologies and tools used in this project
***
hese are its elements:

1. **SQL Server:** SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is used to store and manage data in an application. In this case, it looks like you are using SQL Server as the database engine for your backend. It can be part of a database server hosted in the cloud or on a local server.

2. **C#:** C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft that is commonly used in developing Windows applications and web applications. In this context, C# is used to write backend application logic such as data management, authentication, and security.

3. **Security Log:** A security log refers to the ability to record and audit activities in your application to ensure security and compliance. It can include tracking important events, such as logins, sensitive data changes, and other events relevant to application security.

4. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Google Cloud is Google's cloud platform that offers a wide range of services and resources to host, manage and scale applications in the cloud. In this case, you are using GCP to host and run your backend application. This can include services like Google Compute Engine (for virtual machines), Google Cloud SQL (for databases), and other GCP services to host and manage your infrastructure.

In short, your backend application was developed in C# and uses SQL Server as a database. It is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform to provide scalability, reliability, and other cloud benefits. A security log is also included to audit activities and maintain application security.
